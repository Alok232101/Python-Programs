# tuple data structure
# tuple can be store any data type
# most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created we can't updare
# data inside tuple 
example =('one', 'two', 'three')
# no append, no insert, no pop, no remove
day=('mon', 'tue')
# tupes are faster than list
# methods
# count, index, len function, slicing
print(day[:2])
